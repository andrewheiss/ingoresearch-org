I apologize for the inconvenience! You should only receive two e-mails from me regarding this survey: one initial invitation and one reminder a week later.

If you want to be officially removed from my list of NGOs, please e-mail me at [unsubscribe@ingoresearch.org](mailto:unsubscribe@ingoresearch.org?subject=Unsubscribe me).

Again, sorry!
